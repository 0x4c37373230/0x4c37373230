I'm a Minecraft Bedrock Edition technical player who enjoys coding tools for the game; and hacking in general. I know a decently big amount of python and rust, a bunch of both c++ and js/ts; AutoHotkey and I can read some x86 assembly. I intend to learn nim once I'm completely done with c++ and rust which I'm still learning.  I also sometimes do code digging. You can message me on discord (Luke7720#9140)
