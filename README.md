I'm a Minecraft Bedrock Edition technical player who enjoys coding tools and mods for the game; and hacking in general. I know C++ , rust, a bunch of python, a decent amount of JS/TS and I can read some x86 assembly. I intend to learn nim once I'm completely done with a bunch of things I'm learning.  I also sometimes do code digging. You can message me on discord (Luke7720#9140)
