I'm a Minecraft Bedrock Edition technical player who enjoys coding tools for the game; and hacking in general. I know a decently big amount of python, a bit of both c++ and rust; and AutoHotkey. I intend to learn more languages (java, nim, processing, lua; to name a few) once I'm completely done with c++ and rust which I'm still learning.  I also sometimes do code digging. You can message me on discord (Luke7720#9140)
